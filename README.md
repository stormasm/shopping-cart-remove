### shopping-cart-remove

This shows this [example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart)
with the added functionality of being able to remove items from your cart as well.

So this is NOT the code directly from the redux/example/shopping-cart but a modified version with the scripts/server.js implementation and custom webpack in config as opposed to the
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
which comes out of the box with the sample implementation.  I worked on this code initially and then modified it accordingly to better suit the actual application which is found in my redux fork.
